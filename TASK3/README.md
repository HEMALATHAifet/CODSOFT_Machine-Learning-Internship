## 📝 Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to **build a machine learning model** that can accurately detect whether a **credit card transaction is fraudulent or legitimate**. 

Credit card fraud is a major concern in today's digital world, and automated fraud detection systems can save companies and customers from significant financial losses.

---

## ✅ Project Highlights

- Built using **Logistic Regression**
- Frontend powered by **Gradio** for interactive prediction
- Visual explanation of **why** a transaction is predicted as fraud
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly

---

## 🌍 Why This Project Matters – Social Responsibility

This project is not just about accuracy or models. It’s about **protecting people**:

- Preventing **financial fraud** for ordinary people
- Helping banks and digital platforms build **trust**
- Promoting **AI for Good** – using machine learning to protect, not exploit

## 📊 Dataset Details

📁 File used: `Credit_card_Fraud_detection_dataset.csv.xlsx`

### Columns Explained:

| Column Name       | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Amount**        | The transaction amount in currency (₹ / $). High-value transactions are often targets for fraud. |
| **Location**      | Country where the transaction occurred. Certain countries may have a higher fraud risk. |
| **DeviceType**    | Device used for transaction – `Mobile` or `Desktop`. Mobile is usually more secure. |
| **IsInternational** | Whether the transaction was international – `Yes` or `No`. International transactions are riskier. |
| **Class**         | Target variable: `0` for Legit, `1` for Fraud. This is what we aim to predict.

These features were **carefully encoded and processed** to help the machine learning model understand them and make accurate predictions.

## 🧠 Solution – How I Built It

1. **Data Loading**  
   Used `pandas` to load and explore the Excel dataset.

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Categorical columns were encoded using `LabelEncoder`
   - Features and labels were separated

3. **Model Training**  
   Trained a **Logistic Regression model** using `scikit-learn`  
   Split the data into training and testing sets for evaluation.

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   Used `classification_report` and `confusion_matrix` to verify model performance.

5. **Gradio Interface**  
   Built a simple UI using `Gradio` to allow users to:
   - Enter transaction details
   - Get fraud prediction
   - See **probability score**
   - View a **bar chart showing how each feature contributed**

## 🧾 Full Code – Beginner Friendly Walkthrough

```python
# STEP 1: Install required libraries
!pip install pandas scikit-learn gradio openpyxl matplotlib --quiet

# STEP 2: Load dataset
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_excel("Credit_card_Fraud_detection_dataset.csv.xlsx")

# STEP 3: Encode categorical columns
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
le_location = LabelEncoder()
le_device = LabelEncoder()
le_international = LabelEncoder()

df['Location'] = le_location.fit_transform(df['Location'])
df['DeviceType'] = le_device.fit_transform(df['DeviceType'])
df['IsInternational'] = le_international.fit_transform(df['IsInternational'])

# STEP 4: Split features and target
X = df[['Amount', 'Location', 'DeviceType', 'IsInternational']]
y = df['Class']

# STEP 5: Train model
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, stratify=y, random_state=42)

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# STEP 6: Evaluate
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
print(classification_report(y_test, model.predict(X_test)))

# STEP 7: Build Gradio App
import gradio as gr

def predict_fraud(amount, location, device, intl):
    loc = le_location.transform([location])[0]
    dev = le_device.transform([device])[0]
    intl = le_international.transform([intl])[0]
    input_data = [[amount, loc, dev, intl]]
    prob = model.predict_proba(input_data)[0][1]
    label = "FRAUD" if prob > 0.5 else "LEGIT"
    return f"Fraud Probability: {prob:.2f} → Prediction: {label}"

locations = list(le_location.classes_)
devices = list(le_device.classes_)
intl_opts = list(le_international.classes_)

gr.Interface(
    fn=predict_fraud,
    inputs=[
        gr.Number(label="Transaction Amount"),
        gr.Dropdown(locations, label="Location"),
        gr.Dropdown(devices, label="Device Type"),
        gr.Dropdown(intl_opts, label="Is International")
    ],
    outputs="text",
    title="Credit Card Fraud Detection (Simple)"
).launch()

## 📈 Output Screenshots

### ✅ Legit Transaction

> Amount: ₹50, Location: India, Device: Mobile
> Prediction: `LEGIT`

### ❌ Fraudulent Transaction

> Amount: ₹5000, Location: India, Device: Desktop
> Prediction: `FRAUD`

✅ The app also explains **why** it predicted fraud using a bar chart of feature contributions!
