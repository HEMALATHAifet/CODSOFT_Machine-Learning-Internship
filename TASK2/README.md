# 📩 Spam Message Detector (Task 2 - CodSoft Machine Learning Internship)

This project detects whether a given message is **spam** or **not spam** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a machine learning model. The model is deployed using **Gradio** for easy web interaction.

---

## ✅ 1. Problem Statement

In the age of digital communication, spam messages have become a serious issue. These are unsolicited messages, often containing scams, phishing links, or unwanted promotions.  
The goal of this project is to **build a machine learning model** that can **classify text messages as either 'spam' or 'ham' (not spam)** to improve communication quality and filter out unwanted content.

---

## 🛠️ 2. Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have:

- Python 3.7+
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook / Local Python environment
- Internet connection (to fetch the dataset from a public URL)

---

## 📦 3. Libraries Used and Their Purpose

| Library | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| `pandas` | To load and manipulate tabular data |
| `scikit-learn` | Machine Learning - model building, vectorization, training |
| `gradio` | To create an interactive UI for the spam classifier |

### Install them in Colab:
```bash
!pip install pandas scikit-learn gradio --quiet
````

---

## 🧠 4. Code Explanation with Examples

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
import gradio as gr
```

✅ **Import Libraries**
We import all necessary packages:

* `pandas` for data handling
* `sklearn` modules for ML pipeline
* `gradio` for creating a simple UI

---

```python
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justmarkham/pycon-2016-tutorial/master/data/sms.tsv"
df = pd.read_csv(url, sep="\t", header=None, names=["label", "message"])
```

✅ **Load Dataset**
We fetch the spam dataset from GitHub. It's a `.tsv` (tab-separated) file with 2 columns:

* `label`: 'spam' or 'ham'
* `message`: the text message

---

```python
df['label'] = df['label'].map({'ham': 0, 'spam': 1})
```

✅ **Label Encoding**
Converts text labels:

* `ham → 0`
* `spam → 1`
  To make them machine-readable.

---

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df['message'], df['label'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

✅ **Split the Data**
We split the dataset into:

* `X_train`: training messages
* `X_test`: testing messages
  (80% for training, 20% for testing)

---

```python
model = Pipeline([
    ('vectorizer', CountVectorizer()),
    ('classifier', MultinomialNB())
])
```

✅ **Build ML Pipeline**
This automates two steps:

1. **Vectorizer**: converts text into numerical format using Bag-of-Words.
2. **Classifier**: applies Naive Bayes model to predict spam/ham.

---

```python
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

✅ **Train the Model**
The model learns patterns from the training data.

---

```python
def classify_message(msg):
    prediction = model.predict([msg])[0]
    return "🚫 Spam" if prediction == 1 else "✅ Not Spam"
```

✅ **Prediction Function**
Takes user input message and returns a label:

* 1 → Spam
* 0 → Not Spam

---

```python
iface = gr.Interface(fn=classify_message,
                     inputs=gr.Textbox(lines=2, placeholder="Enter your message here..."),
                     outputs="text",
                     title="📩 Spam Message Classifier",
                     description="Type a message and check if it's Spam or Not")

iface.launch()
```

✅ **Gradio Interface**
This creates a beautiful web UI:

* Input: a text box for message
* Output: classification result
  Launches a local or Colab interface.

---

## 💡 5. Sample Output

Example:

**Input Message:**

```
Congratulations! You've won a free iPhone. Click here to claim.
```

**Output:**

```
🚫 Spam
```

**Another Example:**

**Input Message:**

```
Hi, can we meet tomorrow for the group project?
```

**Output:**

```
✅ Not Spam
```

## 🔄 6. MLOps: Automating & Managing the Project

To make this project production-ready, consider these MLOps practices:

| Step                    | MLOps Tool/Approach                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Experiment Tracking** | Use **MLflow** to log model accuracy, parameters, pipeline version        |
| **Version Control**     | Push code and model to **GitHub**                                         |
| **Deployment**          | Deploy Gradio app to **Hugging Face Spaces** or **Streamlit Cloud**       |
| **Monitoring**          | Track spam detection accuracy with **Grafana** or a simple logging system |
| **Containerization**    | Package with **Docker** for reproducibility                               |
| **CI/CD**               | Use **GitHub Actions** for auto-deploy on push                            |

### Sample MLflow Code Snippet (Optional):

```python
import mlflow

with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "spam-detector-model")
    mlflow.log_param("vectorizer", "CountVectorizer")
    mlflow.log_param("classifier", "MultinomialNB")
```
